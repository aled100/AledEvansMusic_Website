            text: `We were extremely happy with Aled’s performance at our daughter’s 18th birthday celebrations. 
His professionalism stood out from the outset – he sent over a selection of curated playlists allowing us to tailor the music to suit the vibe of the evening.

On the night he got the crowd up dancing and created a lively, joyful atmosphere – he even stayed a little longer and played extra songs on request. 
Thank you Aled for making an unforgettable night for our daughter’s special birthday.`,
