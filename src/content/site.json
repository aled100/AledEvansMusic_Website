      "With over 30 years experience of performing music on stage, he has developed an instinct for reading the room, he creates intimate, singalong moments for ceremonies, drinks receptions, and evening entertainment.",
      "Beyond live performance, Aled brings energy to the dancefloor from behind the decks as well as the guitar as a DJ. From timeless wedding anthems to modern chart-toppers, his carefully crafted DJ sets keep guests of all ages dancing late into the night.",

    "bio": [
      "Music has always been at the heart of who I am, and performing as a wedding singer and guitarist allows me to share that passion in the most meaningful of ways. There’s something incredibly special about playing live on such an important day — creating those magical moments that stay with couples and their guests long after the last song ends. Whether it’s an intimate acoustic rendition of a first dance, or a rousing singalong that fills the dance floor, my goal is always the same: to bring people together through music.",
      "I first picked up a guitar as a teenager and was immediately hooked on the way a simple melody could connect people. Over the years, I’ve honed my craft by performing in pubs, clubs, and private events across South Wales, developing a wide repertoire that blends crowd-pleasing favourites with unique acoustic twists on unexpected songs. Along the way, I’ve grown into the type of performer who can adapt to any atmosphere — from relaxed daytime sets during drinks receptions to high-energy singalongs that lift the roof during evening parties.",
      "What makes my act different is the variety I offer. I’m just as comfortable performing timeless anthems from artists like Oasis, Bruce Springsteen, and Sam Fender as I am reimagining pop hits from Whitney Houston, ABBA, or Ricky Martin in stripped-back, soulful arrangements. People often tell me this mix is what makes their night — because there’s something for everyone, whether it’s the nostalgic pull of a Britpop classic or the surprise of hearing a party anthem delivered acoustically in a fresh and engaging way.",
      "Professionalism is at the core of how I approach every booking. I understand that weddings are once-in-a-lifetime occasions, and I take pride in working closely with each couple to ensure the music perfectly reflects their vision for the day. From learning special requests to carefully planning setlists that flow with the schedule, I aim to make the process stress-free and enjoyable. I also bring all my own professional equipment and provide a polished sound that works for venues of all sizes — from cosy barns to grand reception halls.",
      "Some of my highlights so far include performing at events where guests of all ages ended up singing arm-in-arm to classic anthems, creating a genuine festival-style atmosphere, as well as playing  stripped-down acoustic versions of romantic ballads. These moments are why I do what I do — because music has the power to transform an event into something unforgettable.",
      "As a performer, I bring not just my voice and guitar, but also a relaxed, friendly personality that helps everyone feel at ease. I want couples to feel confident that when they book me, they’re not just hiring a musician, but someone who genuinely cares about making their big day as special as it can possibly be. If you’re looking for a wedding singer and guitarist who can combine heartfelt romance with lively, feel-good energy, I’d love to be part of your celebration. Together, we’ll create the soundtrack to memories that last a lifetime."
